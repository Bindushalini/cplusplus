Gen AI: Unlock Foundational Concepts
Introduction to Generative AI

LI learning notes:
Identifiers are values for variables, classes, functions, types.
starts with digits , letters/underscores.
Should not be a reserved word/keyword.
keywords: int, float, bool, void, class, new, delete, public, private, static, if else, switch, case, for , while etc.
camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case - naming conventions
private member variables - starts with _
Model - representation of reality
Classes are construct for models in c++
Encapsulation: keeping data and operations together for a model and only include info about that model.
model has to be consice.
Inheritance and polymorphism: subclass may inheritance properties from a super class.
And functions in base class can be redefined in derived class - leads to polymorphic behavior.
    Standard Input/Output Library
    String Handling
    Mathematics and Numeric Functions
    Containers and Iterators
    Algorithm Libraries
    C Standard Library Headers  

cin / cout : insertion and extraction operators respectively.
cstdlib includes functions for general utilities, such as memory allocation, process control, and random number generation.
cstdio includes functions for input and output operations, similar to iostream.
C++ Standard Library also provides a variety of mathematical functions through C headers like cmath and cstdlib. These functions include common operations like exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and more

Containers: Such as std::vector, std::list, and std::map.
Algorithms: Functions for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.
Iterators: Objects that allow you to traverse containers.
